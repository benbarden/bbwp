# Boxystrap5

A simple boxy theme based on the Timber starter theme, with added Bootstrap 5.1.

## Installing the Theme

1. Make sure you have installed the plugin for the [Timber Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) (and Advanced Custom Fields - they [play quite nicely](https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/acf-cookbook/#nav) together). 
2. Download the zip for this theme (or clone it) and move it to `wp-content/themes` in your WordPress installation. 
3. Activate the theme in Appearance > Themes.
